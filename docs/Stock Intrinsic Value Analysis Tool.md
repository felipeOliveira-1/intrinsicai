# Stock Intrinsic Value Analysis Tool

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the architecture of a **Stock Intrinsic Value Analysis Tool** designed to help investors determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued using the **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis** approach and **AI-powered Expert Analysis**. The software estimates future cash flows, discounts them to present value, compares the intrinsic value with the current market cap, and provides comprehensive AI-driven market insights.

## 2. Objectives
- Provide an automated tool to assess a stock's intrinsic value
- Perform **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis** with various assumptions
- Incorporate historical financial data, growth projections, and risk factors
- Offer a margin of safety calculation to guide investment decisions
- Enable users to adjust assumptions (growth rate, discount rate, etc.) for more accurate valuation
- Provide **AI-powered expert analysis** for comprehensive market insights
- Combine quantitative metrics with qualitative AI analysis for better decision-making

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Input Data
- **Stock Ticker**: User enters a stock symbol
- **Financial Data**: The software retrieves financial data (Operating Cash Flow, CapEx, Free Cash Flow, Market Cap, etc.) via Yahoo Finance API
- **User Assumptions**: Users can set:
  - Expected **Growth Rate** (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)
  - Desired **Discount Rate** (e.g., 10%, 15%)
  - **Margin of Safety** (e.g., 30%, 50%)
  - **Terminal Value Calculation Method** (Gordon Growth Model or P/E Multiple)
- **AI Analysis**: System processes financial metrics through GPT-4 for expert insights

### 3.2 Processing Logic
- Calculate **Owner's Earnings**:
  - Owner's Earnings = Operating Cash Flow - Maintenance CapEx
- Forecast **Future Cash Flows**:
  - Project cash flows for 10 years using growth rate assumptions
- Compute **Terminal Value**:
  - Use either the Gordon Growth Model or Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow (P/FCF) Multiple
- Discount Future Cash Flows to Present Value:
  - Formula: **PV = Future Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^Years**
- Calculate **Intrinsic Value**:
  - Sum of all discounted cash flows + Terminal Value
- Compare with **Market Cap**:
  - Determine if the stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued
- Generate **AI Analysis**:
  - Process financial metrics through GPT-4
  - Generate expert insights and recommendations
  - Provide market context and risk assessment

### 3.3 Output
- **Intrinsic Value per Share**
- **Fair Value Range** (with margin of safety applied)
- **Buy, Hold, or Sell Recommendation**
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Show how changes in assumptions affect valuation
- **Historical Valuation Comparison**
- **AI Expert Analysis**:
  - Market context and insights
  - Risk assessment
  - Growth prospects evaluation
  - Competitive analysis
  - Investment recommendation
  - Industry-specific considerations

## 4. System Architecture
### 4.1 High-Level Design
- **Frontend (User Interface)**: Terminal-based interface (using Typer)
- **Backend (Business Logic & API Integration)**:
  - Python (using yfinance, pandas, and rich)
  - OpenAI GPT-4 integration for AI analysis
- **External Data Sources**:
  - Yahoo Finance API for financial data
  - OpenAI API for expert analysis
